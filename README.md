# NebGov

**Permissionless on-chain governance for every Soroban protocol.**

NebGov is the canonical governance framework for the Stellar ecosystem — a modular, auditable, and composable set of smart contracts that any Soroban protocol can plug into to add on-chain governance.

## Quick Start

Get started by deploying your first NebGov DAO to the Stellar testnet in under 10 minutes:

👉 **[Deploy your first DAO on Stellar with NebGov](./docs/tutorial.md)**

### Local development stack (Docker)

Bring up Postgres + indexer + backend + app with one command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set GOVENOR_ADDRESS in .env (required)
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

- App: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend health: `http://localhost:3001/health`
- Indexer health: `http://localhost:3002/health`

For full setup instructions and contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

For a step-by-step local development guide, see [docs/local-development.md](./docs/local-development.md).
