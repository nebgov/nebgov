//! Proposer Reputation System (Issue #771).
//!
//! Tracks each proposer's proposal outcome history, computes a rolling
//! reputation score, and derives a reputation-adjusted effective proposal
//! threshold so that a proven, high-participation proposer can propose at a
//! discount while a repeat spammer pays a penalty. All storage/behavior here
//! is additive: until an address has proposals recorded,
//! `get_effective_threshold` degrades to the flat `proposal_threshold`, so
//! existing governance flows are unaffected by default beyond the one
//! call-site change in `lib.rs`.
//!
//! `ReputationConfig::enabled` exists in the struct and is honoured by
//! `get_effective_threshold` (an `enabled == false` config would make it a
//! no-op), but it is currently a **compile-time constant with no runtime
//! toggle**: `get_config` always returns `default_config()` (`enabled: true`)
//! and no setter persists a different value. There is no operational
//! kill-switch today — one requires the `ReputationConfig` setter tracked
//! separately.
